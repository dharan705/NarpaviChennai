            <p>
              At Narpavi, our research publication workflow is structured to ensure a smooth and professional journey from draft to publication. It begins with a detailed consultation where we evaluate your research topic, identify suitable publication targets (SCI, Scopus, UGC, IEEE, or ISBN-based), and outline a customized strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the manuscript type is chosen—journal article, review paper, conference paper, or book—our domain experts begin the writing process. We ensure plagiarism-free content, apply precise formatting (APA, IEEE, or journal-specific), and conduct multiple internal reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              After formatting, we handle journal/publisher selection, submit the paper on your behalf, and monitor the peer review or editorial review process. We also assist in revisions, rebuttals, and proof corrections, leading all the way to acceptance and final publication.
            </p>

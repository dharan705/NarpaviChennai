      <p>
        Springer is a well-known academic publisher that publishes conference proceedings across many disciplines.
        While it doesn’t offer a specific “Springer Conference Paper Publication Service” as a standalone offering,
        it plays a key role in organizing and publishing conference papers after peer review.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you submit to a conference affiliated with Springer, your paper typically goes through a formal review
        process. If accepted, the paper may be presented at the conference and later included in the Springer-published
        proceedings.
